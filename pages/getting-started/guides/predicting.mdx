# Understanding Market Odds

## How Prediction Markets Work
Kash uses **binary prediction markets** where prices represent probabilities:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Price = Probability">
    - **YES at \$0.72** = 72% chance of event happening
    - **NO at \$0.28** = 28% chance of event NOT happening
    - **Always sums to \$1.00** = 100% probability total
    - **Prices change** as people place predictions and new information emerges
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Your Potential Returns">
    - **Buy YES at \$0.72** - You pay \$0.72 per share
    - **If YES wins:** You receive \$1.00 per share
    - **Your profit:** \$0.28 per share (38.9% return)
    - **If NO wins:** You lose your prediction entirely
    - **Example:** \$100 prediction → 138.89 shares → \$138.89 if correct
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Market Dynamics">
    - **Early predictions** often get better rates before consensus forms
    - **Breaking news** can rapidly shift prices
    - **Large predictions** move rates more than small ones
    - **Smart money** keeps markets efficient through arbitrage
    - **Social sentiment** influences prediction patterns
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
