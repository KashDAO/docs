# After Withdrawal

## Confirmation Signs
**Your withdrawal was successful when you see:**
- **Transaction hash provided** by @kash_bot or dashboard
- **Blockchain confirmation** (usually within 2 minutes)
- **Funds appear in destination** wallet or exchange
- **Kash balance updated** to reflect withdrawal

## Troubleshooting
If your withdrawal doesn't arrive:
1. **Check the transaction hash** on Base block explorer
2. **Verify correct network** - ensure destination supports Base
3. **Contact support** - DM @kash_bot with transaction details
4. **Allow extra time** - some exchanges may take longer to credit

<Tip>
Your funds are always yours. Kash provides the prediction platform, but you maintain complete control over deposits and withdrawals!
