# Automatic Winning Process

## Instant Settlement System
When an event concludes, Kash's AI resolution system:

1. **Fetches verified results** from multiple trusted data sources
2. **Validates outcome** using zero-knowledge proofs for transparency
3. **Processes payouts** automatically via smart contracts
4. **Credits winners instantly** - no manual claims or delays

# Understanding Payouts

## Payout Mathematics
**Simple and transparent:**
- **Each winning share pays exactly $1.00** when the market resolves
- **Your shares × $1.00 = total payout**
- **Profit = payout - original prediction amount**
- **Return % = (payout ÷ prediction amount) - 1**
