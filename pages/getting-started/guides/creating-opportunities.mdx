# How Market Creation Works

**AI agents create all markets**, but users play a crucial role by suggesting ideas. When you tag @kash_bot with a market suggestion, our specialized AI evaluates it and may create the market if it meets quality standards.

## Two Ways Markets Get Created

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Automatic Detection">
    **AI agents monitor social signals**
    
    1. **Social listening** detects trending topics across platforms
    2. **AI evaluation** assesses prediction potential and engagement
    3. **Quality validation** ensures verifiable outcomes
    4. **Instant deployment** creates markets automatically
    5. **Community notification** alerts potential predictors
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="User Suggestions">
    **Tag @kash_bot to suggest markets**
    
    **Natural posts:**
    ```
    "I think the next iPhone will have an AI chip. @kash_bot"
    ```
    
    **Direct requests:**
    ```
    "@kash_bot create market: Will Taylor Swift announce a world tour in 2025?"
    ```
    
    **What happens:**
    1. AI detects your suggestion and evaluates quality
    2. Validates market potential and verifiability  
    3. Creates market if approved
    4. Credits you as suggester with potential rewards
