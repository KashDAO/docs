# Token Buyback Mechanism

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Automated Buyback System">
    **Monthly Treasury Operations**
    
    **Revenue Sources:**
    - **2% Trading Fees:** Primary revenue from all prediction market trades
    - **Aave Lending Yield:** Interest earned on idle USDC deposits in treasury
    - **Auto Swap Revenue:** Small spread capture from 0x protocol token conversions
    - **MEV Capture:** Revenue from transaction optimization and private mempool routing
    - **Strategic Partnerships:** Revenue sharing from ecosystem integrations
    
    **Monthly Buyback Process:**
    1. Treasury accumulates USDC from platform fees
    2. Smart contract calculates optimal buyback amount
    3. Automated purchase from USDC/KASH liquidity pool
    4. Bought tokens distributed for community incentives
    
    **Smart Buyback Formula:**
    ```
    Bₘ = min((0.005 × S / V̄) × Vₘᵉᵐᵃ, 0.01 × S)
    
    Where:
    - Vₘᵉᵐᵃ = γVₘ + (1-γ)Vₘ₋₁ᵉᵐᵃ (exponential moving average)
    - γ = 0.3 (smoothing factor, variable based on market metrics)
    - V̄ = 1/12 × Σ(Vₘ₋ᵢᵉᵐᵃ) for i=1 to 12 (12-month average)
    - S = total supply of $KASH tokens
    ```
    
    **Buyback Constraints:**
    - Maximum 1% of supply bought back per month
    - Targets ~0.5% of supply in liquidity pool (similar to Sky/MakerDAO)
    - Formula engineered to yield around 0.5% buyback rate
    - Creates consistent buying pressure from protocol success

    ```
    
    **Module Interactions:**
    - **Treasury Core Module:** Central hub storing all USDC, $KASH, LP tokens, and sub-fund balances
    - **Asset Manager Module:** Automatically deploys idle USDC to Aave for yield generation
    - **Smart Burn Module:** Calculates and executes monthly $KASH buybacks from accumulated fees
    - **Bond Depository Module:** Enables LPs to buy $KASH at discount for fast liquidity bootstrapping
    - **Risk Fund Module:** Maintains reserves for bug bounties and insurance coverage
    - **Community Rewards Module:** Distributes bought-back tokens as staking rewards and incentives
    
    **Operational Flow:**
    1. **Fee Collection:** 2% trading fees accumulate in Treasury Core
    2. **Yield Generation:** Idle USDC automatically deployed to Aave for interest
    3. **Monthly Buyback:** Smart contract calculates optimal $KASH purchase amount
    4. **Token Distribution:** Bought tokens distributed to stakers and community programs
    5. **Risk Management:** Portion allocated to risk fund for platform security
    
    **Governance Controls:**
    - **Parameter Adjustment:** Community can modify buyback formulas and allocation percentages
    - **Yield Strategy:** Governance approves new yield protocols and risk parameters
    - **Emergency Powers:** Multi-sig can pause operations in extreme circumstances
    - **Transparency:** All treasury operations publicly auditable on-chain
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Revenue Generation from Lending and Swaps">
    **Maximizing Treasury Efficiency**
    
    **Aave Integration for Yield:**
    - **Idle USDC Deployment:** Treasury automatically deposits unused USDC into Aave
    - **Conservative Risk Profile:** Only blue-chip lending protocols with proven track records
    - **Yield Optimization:** Smart contract monitors rates and rebalances for optimal returns
    - **Liquidity Management:** Maintains sufficient liquid reserves for platform operations
    
    **Auto Swap Revenue Model:**
    - **0x Protocol Integration:** Users can predict with any ERC-20 token (ETH, WETH, DAI, etc.)
    - **Automatic Conversion:** Tokens instantly swapped to USDC for predicting
    - **Spread Capture:** Small percentage of swap spread retained by treasury
    - **Gas Optimization:** Batch swaps reduce overall transaction costs
    
    **Revenue Distribution:**
    ```
    Example Monthly Revenue Breakdown:
    - Trading Fees (2%): $45,000 (primary source)
    - Aave Lending Yield: $3,200 (on $2M treasury)
    - Auto Swap Spreads: $1,800 (from token conversions)
    - MEV Capture: $2,000 (from large trade protection)
    Total: $52,000 → $KASH Buybacks
    ```
    
    **Risk Management:**
    - **Diversified Yield Sources:** Multiple revenue streams reduce dependency
    - **Conservative Allocation:** Maximum 70% of treasury in yield protocols
    - **Emergency Withdrawal:** Instant liquidity access for platform needs
    - **Regular Audits:** Quarterly reviews of yield strategy performance

  <Accordion title="Economic Alignment">
    **Sustainable Protocol Economics**
    
    **Revenue Model:**
    - 2% fee on all trading volume

    - No entity profits - all goes to community
    - Transparent fee distribution
    
    **Community Benefits:**

    - Staking yields incentivize holding
    - Governance participation increases utility
    
    **Growth Mechanics:**
    - Higher trading volume → larger buybacks

    - Platform success directly benefits token holders
    - Community ownership drives innovation
    
    **Risk Management:**
    - Maximum 1% monthly buyback limit
    - Controlled token release schedules
    - Emergency pause mechanisms
    - Community governance oversight
