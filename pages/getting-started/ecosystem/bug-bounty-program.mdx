<Warning>
Always report security issues privately to security@kash.bot before public disclosure. Public disclosure of vulnerabilities before they're fixed can put user funds and the platform at risk.
</Warning>

<Tip>
Security research is most effective when combined with deep understanding of the platform's architecture and user needs. Take time to understand how Kash works before looking for potential issues.
