# Account Security Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How do I secure my Kash account?">
    **Comprehensive Security Checklist**
    
    **X Account Security (Critical):**
    - **Enable 2FA:** Use authenticator app or SMS verification
    - **Strong Password:** Use unique, complex password for X
    - **Monitor Sessions:** Regularly check active login sessions
    - **Verify Emails:** Be cautious of phishing emails claiming to be from X
    
    **Kash-Specific Security:**
    - **Verify Bot:** Only interact with verified @kash_bot account
    - **Check URLs:** Always verify kash.bot domain before login
    - **Monitor Notifications:** Review all transaction notifications
    - **Regular Reviews:** Check account activity and balances regularly
    
    **Device and Network Security:**
    - **Secure Devices:** Use updated, secure devices for access
    - **Private Networks:** Avoid public WiFi for account access
    - **Browser Security:** Keep browsers updated and use secure extensions
    - **Antivirus Software:** Maintain updated security software
    
    **Advanced Security Measures:**
    - Monitor account activity regularly
    - Use hardware security keys when available
    - Regularly update all passwords and security settings
    - Be aware of social engineering attempts
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="How do session keys and spending limits work?">
    **Advanced Wallet Security Features**
    
    **Session Keys:**
    - **Temporary Authorization:** Allow @kash_bot to execute small transactions on your behalf
    - **Limited Scope:** Only for prediction actions, not withdrawals or large transactions
    - **Time Limits:** Sessions expire automatically after predetermined periods
    - **Revocable:** You can revoke session access at any time through your X account
    
    **Spending Limits:**
    - **Daily Limits:** Maximum amount that can be predicted per day through automated sessions
    - **Transaction Limits:** Maximum size per individual prediction without manual approval
    - **Customizable:** You can adjust limits based on your comfort level
    - **Override Protection:** Large transactions always require explicit authorization
    
    **How It Works:**
    ```
    Example: $50 daily limit, $20 per transaction
    - "YES $15" → Executes automatically via session key
    - "YES $25" → Requires manual approval due to limit
    - Total daily predictions > $50 → Manual approval required
    ```
    
    **Security Benefits:**
    - **Convenience without Risk:** Fast prediction for small amounts, security for large ones
    - **Granular Control:** You decide exactly what the bot can do automatically
    - **Audit Trail:** All session activity is logged and reviewable
    -     **Emergency Revocation:** Instantly disable all automated access if needed
