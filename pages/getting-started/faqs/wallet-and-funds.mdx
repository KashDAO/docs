<Warning>
Your wallet security depends on X account security. Enable 2FA, use strong passwords, and never share account credentials. Kash cannot recover funds if you lose access to your X account.
</Warning>

<Tip>
The MPC wallet system eliminates seed phrase management while maintaining security. Your X account serves as the master key, making recovery simple but dependent on X account access.
