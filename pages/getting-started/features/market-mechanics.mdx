    - **2%** fee on all trades (buying or selling shares)
    - **No additional fees** on winnings, losses, or holding positions
    - **Transparent** calculation shown before and after each trade
    
    **Example Calculation:**
    ```
    Trade: $100 on YES at $0.40 = 250 shares
    Platform Fee: $100 × 2% = $2.00
    Net Cost: $102.00 total
    If YES wins: 250 shares × $1.00 = $250
    Net Profit: $250 - $102 = $148.00 (145% return)
    ```

# Resolution and Settlement

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Trusted Data Sources">
    **Pre-Defined Resolution Criteria**
    
    Each market specifies exact resolution parameters:
    - **Primary Sources:** Official websites, APIs, verified data feeds
    - **Secondary Sources:** Backup verification from reputable outlets
    - **Resolution Criteria:** Specific language defining winning conditions
    - **Dispute Process:** Community governance for edge cases
    
    **Common Source Types:**
    - Government agencies and official bodies
    - Sports leagues and official results pages
    - Financial data providers (Bloomberg, Reuters)
    - Company investor relations and SEC filings
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Cryptographic Resolution Process">
    **Trustless Settlement with Zero-Knowledge Proofs**
    
    **How It Works (Step-by-Step):**
    1. **Market Closure:** Trading stops at predetermined time
    2. **Secure Data Fetching:** AI agent connects to pre-specified trusted source (e.g., official results page)
    3. **zkTLS Authentication:** Cryptographic proof generated that data actually came from the claimed website
    4. **AI Analysis:** Natural Language Processing model analyzes the fetched data to determine YES/NO outcome
    5. **Zero-Knowledge Proof:** Mathematical proof generated that the AI model made the correct decision on authentic data
    6. **Blockchain Verification:** Combined proof submitted to smart contract on Base blockchain
    7. **Instant Settlement:** Contract automatically pays winners $1.00 per winning share
    
    **Why This Matters:**
    - **No human bias** - AI follows predetermined rules consistently
    - **Cryptographically secure** - impossible to fake data sources or manipulate AI decisions
    - **Instant resolution** - no waiting for committees or manual verification
    - **Publicly verifiable** - anyone can check that resolution was correct
    - **Dispute-resistant** - mathematical proofs eliminate most potential disagreements
    
    **Trust Through Technology:**
    Instead of trusting a person or company to determine outcomes fairly, you're trusting mathematics and cryptography - the same technology that secures Bitcoin and Ethereum. The AI model weights are public, the data sources are specified in advance, and the entire process generates cryptographic proofs that can be independently verified.
    
    **Publicly Verifiable AI Models:**
    - **Open Model Weights:** All AI model parameters publicly available for inspection
    - **Deterministic Inference:** Same inputs always produce identical outputs
    - **Cryptographic Commitment:** Model weights committed to blockchain before market creation
    - **Version Control:** All model updates tracked and governed by community
    
    **Auditability Features:**
    - **Reproducible Results:** Anyone can verify AI decisions using public weights
    - **Model Transparency:** Complete neural network architecture publicly documented
    - **Training Data Disclosure:** Information about training datasets and methodologies
    - **Bias Detection:** Community can analyze models for potential biases or manipulation
    
    **How Model Verification Works:**
    ```
    Verification Process:
    1. Download public model weights from IPFS/Arweave
    2. Run same input data through model locally
    3. Compare your result with on-chain resolution
    4. Mathematical proof confirms identical computation
    ```
    
    **Privacy-Preserving Features:**
    - **Selective Disclosure:** Only necessary data elements are revealed in proofs
    - **Data Minimization:** Personal information in source data is automatically redacted
    - **Computation Privacy:** AI inference happens without exposing sensitive intermediate values
    - **Audit Without Exposure:** Verification possible without revealing private data sources
    
    **Community Oversight:**
    The combination of public model weights and zero-knowledge proofs creates unprecedented transparency. The community can verify that AI models are fair and unbiased, while the zkTLS system ensures the data being analyzed is authentic. This eliminates the need to trust any centralized authority for market resolution.
    
    **Technical Proof Chain Architecture:**
    - **Layer 1 - Data Authenticity:** zkTLS proves data came from claimed source
    - **Layer 2 - AI Inference:** EZKL proves correct model execution on authentic data
    - **Layer 3 - Result Verification:** Combined proof submitted to Base blockchain
    - **Layer 4 - Community Audit:** Public verification of entire proof chain
    
    **Proof Composition Process:**
    ```
    Proof Chain Generation:
    1. zkTLS generates proof P1: "Data D came from source S"
    2. EZKL generates proof P2: "Model M correctly processed D → Result R"
    3. Proof combiner creates P3: "P1 ∧ P2 → R is valid"
    4. P3 submitted to resolution contract on Base
    5. Smart contract verifies P3 and executes payout
    ```
    
    **Cryptographic Guarantees:**
    - **Non-repudiation:** Impossible to deny data source or AI decision
    - **Immutability:** Proofs cannot be modified after generation
    - **Verifiability:** Anyone can independently verify the proof chain
    - **Privacy-Preservation:** Sensitive data elements remain hidden
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Edge Case Handling">
    **Comprehensive Coverage**
    
    **Market Invalidation:**
    - Event cancelled or significantly changed
    - All participants receive full refund of original stakes
    - No fees charged for invalid markets
    
    **Ambiguous Outcomes:**
    - Community governance process activated
    - $KASH token holders vote on resolution
    - Majority decision determines final outcome
    
    **Technical Failures:**
    - Backup resolution mechanisms available
    - User funds always protected
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
