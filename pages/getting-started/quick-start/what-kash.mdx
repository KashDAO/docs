# An AI-Powered Decentralized Prediction Markets Protocol

Kash is a cutting-edge decentralized prediction markets platform that enables **anyone to create and trade on outcome markets directly from X (Twitter) posts**. Built on Base (Coinbase's Ethereum Layer-2 network), Kash uses blockchain technology, AI agents, and zero-knowledge cryptography to create a seamless social prediction experience.

Unlike traditional prediction markets where only platforms can create markets through approval processes, Kash enables **permissionless market creation** - anyone can create markets instantly without gatekeepers or restrictions.

    - **Real-time monitoring** of X, Reddit, news feeds, and existing prediction markets
    - **Prediction-Neural Behavioral Score** based on engagement, uncertainty, and viral potential
    - **Cross-validation** between agents prevents duplicate or low-quality markets

# Market Mechanics

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="How Pricing Works">
    **Probability-Based Pricing**
    
    Market prices directly reflect outcome probabilities:
    - **YES at $0.70** = 70% implied probability
    - **NO at $0.30** = 30% implied probability
    - **Always sums to $1.00** for complete market
    - **Prices adjust** with each trade based on supply and demand
    
    **Example:**
    ```
    Market: "Will Bitcoin reach $100k by March 1st?"
    YES: $0.65 (65% chance)
    NO: $0.35 (35% chance)
    ```
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Binary Outcomes">
    **Simple YES/NO Structure**
    
    Every Kash market has exactly two outcomes:
    - **YES:** The event will happen as stated
    - **NO:** The event will not happen as stated
    - **Clear resolution criteria** specified at market creation
    - **Verifiable sources** predetermined for outcome verification
    
    **Market Examples:**
    - "Will the Lakers win tonight's game?"
    - "Will Apple announce a new iPhone model this month?"
    - "Will the Fed raise rates at the next meeting?"
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Payouts & Fees">
    **Winner-Take-All System**
    
    **Winning Scenario:**
    - Correct outcome shares pay **$1.00 each**
    - Incorrect outcome shares pay **$0.00**
    - **2% platform fee** on all trades
    - **Instant settlement** upon market resolution
    
    **Example Calculation:**
    ```
    Your prediction: 100 YES shares at $0.60 = $60 cost
    Platform fee: $60 × 2% = $1.20
    Total cost: $61.20
    If YES wins: 100 shares × $1.00 = $100 payout
    Net profit: $100 - $61.20 = $38.80 (63% return)
    ```
  </Tab>
